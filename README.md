It is used to create digital diary, where you can list your every day tasks. Works for every year.
If you will use similar syntax for all days, you can create script to parse this diary. 
Also this diary was made as a part of time management system also known as "tomato method". 
In this system every 25minets count as a cycle.

You can use for example this syntax for tasks:

```

-      => not done
+      => done
+-     => particularly done
<!>    => how many cycles done for a day
[]     => how many days in a row some task was comleted
tasks: => group of tasks
{
	+/-/+- task 1
	+/-/+- task 2
	+/-/+- task 3
}

```
